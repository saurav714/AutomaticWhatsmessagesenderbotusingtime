📲 WhatsApp Auto Message Sender Bot
This Python bot uses PyWhatKit to automatically send WhatsApp messages at a specified time, date, and to a specific phone number.

✅ Features
Sends WhatsApp messages automatically.

Schedule messages with hour and minute precision.

Easy to configure with phone number and message content.

⚙️ Requirements
Install the required Python package:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pywhatkit
🧠 How It Works
This script uses pywhatkit.sendwhatmsg() to schedule a message at the given time.

📝 Example Code
python
Copy
Edit
import pywhatkit

# Send a WhatsApp message
# Syntax: sendwhatmsg(phone_number, message, time_hour, time_minute)

pywhatkit.sendwhatmsg("+911234567890", "Hello, this is an automated message!", 14, 30)
This sends the message at 2:30 PM to the given number. Make sure:

Your system time is correct.

WhatsApp Web is logged in on your default browser.

Python script runs a few minutes before the scheduled time.

📅 Advanced: Send on Specific Date
You can use the sendwhatmsg_to_group_instantly() or sendwhatmsg_instantly() for more advanced use cases, or combine with datetime module to automate on specific days.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
from datetime import datetime
import pywhatkit

now = datetime.now()
pywhatkit.sendwhatmsg("+911234567890", "Good morning!", now.hour, now.minute + 2)
⚠️ Notes
The script opens WhatsApp Web in your browser and sends the message.

Don't close your browser or PC before the message is sent.

PyWhatKit gives you 15 seconds to scan the QR code if not logged in.
